This guy came on stage and didn't hear my name properly, so he started to make up all different names. He asked me if it was Kate. I said, “Yeah, Kate is a drag name.” Then I started to just make it more simple, and decided Bob…Bob the Drag Queen…and I thought it was funny, and then I created my name.

Sonique's drag name comes from the same-named British artist. She likes it because it sounds powerful (like sonic powers) and it's a one-word name, just as she wanted. She decided to go by her real full name, Kylie Sonique Love on All Stars 6, saying you only do additions, never subtractions.

When she did drag for the first time, a friend said she 'looked like a Patty'. Though she thought it was a horrid name, she decided to go with it. Her last name comes from her initials, P.A.M., she didn't think the surname 'Pam' was any good, so she decided to double it.
